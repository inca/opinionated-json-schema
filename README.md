# Highly opinionated JSON schema

Here's what you need to know:

1. This package is designed to work with [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) — the awesome JSON validator library.
2. It constrains JSON schema to a very strict subset of functionality.
3. It caters to only specific use cases (e.g. union types, `$ref`, `$oneOf`, `$allOf` and many other things are deliberately not supported).
4. You probably don't need it.
